Testing
=======

We maintain a high code coverage percentage with unit and integration tests for all code.
We are using a package called Coverage (https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/)
to track code coverage.

To run unit tests without using Coverage:

.. parsed-literal::
    $ python manage.py test

To run unit tests using Coverage with comprehensive code coverage report generated into an HTML file:

.. parsed-literal::
    coverage run manage.py test && coverage combine && coverage html

.. note::

    This command will generate a directory that is ignored by Git via our .gitignore file. To see the
    code coverage open the file /coverage_html/index.html in a browser.

.. note::
    Coverage options are specified in a configuration file called .coveragerc. This is where you would
    add files/directories you want to omit from the Coverage report.

.. note::
    'coverage combine' will take the coverage files created for multipricesses (located in the base directory)
    and will combine them with the main coverage files . If a test using multiprocessing fails these
    coverage files will remain and must be deleted manually.

We also tried to split unit and integration tests up between core PresQT code and Target code. Tests
that cover core code reside in ``presqt/api_v1/tests/`` while target tests that cover target functions
reside in ``presqt/targets/{target_name}/tests/`` .

.. attention::
    curateND and Github tests require their tokens to be stored as environment variables since
    these tokens can not be stored publicly. Contact an administrator for access to these.
