Project Overview
==================================

The Overall Goal of PresQT
--------------------------
The development team is tasked to deliver tools and services that allow enhancement of and action on 
metadata related to keywords, provenance, quality, and fixity and ensure that such enhancements and 
actions are also portable/queryable/executable across repository systems

For extended development teams at partner organizations their jobs are to support interoperability 
testing (help conceive of and build the tests, help do the testing)  of our tools and features against 
the target systems they develop or use. For the testing only partners at the collaborating organizations 
they may provide testing or testers on their own systems or to do testing on our's.
